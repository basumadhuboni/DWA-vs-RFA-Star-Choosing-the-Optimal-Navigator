# DWA-vs-RFA-Star-Choosing-the-Optimal-Navigator
The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed
comparison of two of the most widely used unmanned aerial
vehicle(UAV) path planning algorithms: Dynamic Window Algorithm
(DWA) and R5DOS Feature Attention A-star(RFA-Star).
Both algorithms have been coded in Python and simulated on
2D grids with randomly scattered and densely clustered obstacle
distributions, as well as on 3D terrains with complex features
such as mountains. Performance metrics such as path length,
computation time, reaction time, and obstacle avoidance have
been calculated for the simulations. This study highlights the
specific types of environment in which each algorithm performs
best, along with the types of sensors typically required for
their effective operation. The experiments indicate that DWA is
best suited for highly dynamic and low or moderately clustered
obstacles because of its reactive nature and adaptability, whereas
RFA is more effective in dense structured obstacle environments
where global optimality is essential. The results of this research
provide a guideline on which path planning algorithm should be
selected depending on the operational environment.
